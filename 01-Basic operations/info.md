# Printing Text
Write print("X") where X is text you want to print.
If you want to print number I'd recommend writing the number without Speech Marks (not print("number"), but print(number))

# Variables

Are like boxes that have a value written on a piece of paper(for ex. a number or a string (text in speech marks("") )
To define: local name = value (example: local hilua = "Hello, Lua")
You can then print the value by writing the name of the variable like print(hilua) (OUTPUT: "Hello, Lua")
You can change the value like:
local num = 5 (num is set to 5)
num = num + 8 (num is set to num + 8 (to 13))

# Doing Math
You can print math results like "print(15 + 2) (OUTPUTS: 17)", etc.

You can set a variable's value to a math operation like:
local addition = 5 + 6
print(addition)

(OUTPUT: 11)

# Comments

Are like text that the LUA Interpreter(program that reads and runs the code)  ignores.
Defined by --
Example:
print(69) -- Prints 69 to the screen
